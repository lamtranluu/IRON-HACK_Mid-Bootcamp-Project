## 👀 Scenario 
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/TGR2xO6HopOhraWYDo/giphy.gif" width="80px">

- We're Data Analysts hired by a Real Estate company.  
- We're set to build a **machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses** based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated.
- The company has also demanded us to explore the characteristics of the houses using some business intelligence tools. In particular, they're interested in understanding which factors are responsible for higher property value - $650K and above.
- [Data Source](https://github.com/ironhack-edu/data_mid_bootcamp_project_regression)
- [Project guidelines](https://github.com/ironhack-edu/data_mid_bootcamp_project_regression)

## 🎯 Objectives 
**1. Building a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset (R2 score objective: 0,9).**

**2. Visualizing the features that have an impact on properties with high value - $650K and above.**

## ⚙️ Process:
 1. **Setting up our working environment**: Trello & Github repository
 
 2. **Business Understanding**:
 - Identifying the Real Estate company's requests
 - Understanding the meaning of each variable in the Real Estate context
 - Designing an efficient, realistic timeline to adhere to
 
 3. **Data Exploration**: 
 - Performing preliminary Data Cleaning to prepare the data for the SQL & Tableau tasks
 - [SQL](https://github.com/lamtranluu/IRON-HACK_Mid-Bootcamp-Project/tree/main/SQL)
 - [Tableau tasks](https://github.com/lamtranluu/IRON-HACK_Mid-Bootcamp-Project/tree/main/Tableau)
 - Visualization in Jupyter Notebook
 
 4. **Data Preparation**:
 - Implementing thorough Data Cleaning
 - Feature Engineering/Extraction before the Modeling stage
 - Feature Selection was performed in the Modeling stage
 - Different data preprocessing methods have been implemented in the different Modeling iterations
 
 5. **Data Modeling**:
 - **9** different models implemented in **7** different iterations:
    - Linear regression
    - Lasso regression
    - Support vector machine
    - Decision trees regression
    - Random forest regression
    - K Neighbors regression
    - Gradient boosting regression
    - Kernel ridge regression
    - Bayesian ridge regression
 - Optimal hyperparameters were found for the Gradient Boosting model
 
 6. **Present Results**:
 - Present result after **7** round
