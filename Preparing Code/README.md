## Stage 1: 
- Understand the data. Look at profiling report to understand the detail of each variables
- Agree on the implementation
## Stage 2: 
- 





Univariable study. We'll just focus on the dependent variable ('SalePrice') and try to know a little bit more about it.
Multivariate study. We'll try to understand how the dependent variable and independent variables relate.
Basic cleaning. We'll clean the dataset and handle the missing data, outliers and categorical variables.
Test assumptions. We'll check if our data meets the assumptions required by most multivariate techniques.
